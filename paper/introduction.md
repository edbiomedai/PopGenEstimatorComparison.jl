# On Double Robust Estimators in Population Genetics

What makes population genetics different from well studied causal inference settings: 

1. Small or very small effect sizes --> to relate to finite sample size
2. Treatment Imbalance: positivity violation
3. Factorial Treatments
4. Interactions

## Methods

Assumptions:

- The PCs are a good confounding representation. This implies that the genetic variants are independent given the PCs => I suppose this could be verified.
